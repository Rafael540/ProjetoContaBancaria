# Bank Account Project

💳 **Bank Account System in Java**

This project simulates a simple bank account system using the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in Java. The application allows users to create an account with a number, holder name, initial balance, and withdraw limit. Then, the system performs a withdrawal operation, applying validations with custom exception handling.

## 🧩 Features
- Account creation with basic data
- Withdrawal operations with business rules:
  - The amount cannot exceed the withdraw limit
  - The balance must be sufficient for the transaction
- Exception handling with clear messages for the user

## 🎯 Objective
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates how to apply **encapsulation**, **custom exceptions** (`DomainException`), and good practices using a clean package structure (`entities` and `exceptions`) in Java.
